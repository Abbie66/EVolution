# EVolution
The EV-olution Hub project aims to create a comprehensive online platform that serves as a central hub for electric vehicles (EVs) in Kenya. As the country experiences a surge in EV adoption, this platform will provide valuable resources, foster community engagement, and promote sustainable mobility.
